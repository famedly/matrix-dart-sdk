    # We enable a few additional rules not in the default and recommended sets.
    # Those in general have low impact on correct code apart from possibly requiring an additional keyword (like async,
    # await, final) or asking you to move a statement to a different line.  However many of these linter rules make the
    # code either more uniform or avoid bug prone behaviour. For example not awaiting a future usually is a mistake.
    # You can always disable a linter warning with a comment like `// ignore: unawaited_futures`. Please add reasoning,
    # why you disable the rule in such cases. This helps others understand, that you explicitly want a behaviour, that
    # usually would be considered a mistake.
