#### How to migrate from onMigration to onInitStateChanged

**Before:**
```dart
Client('Name', onMigration: () {
  print('Migrating now....');

```dart
Client('Name', onInitStateChanged: (state) {
  if (state == InitState.migratingDatabase) {

## [0.35.0] 11th November 2024
Fixes a minor performance leak where the app re-requests the member list of all encrypted rooms.
For this the parameter `cache` in `Room.requestParticipants()` is now also
responsible to store the member data in the database. Also it is not `true` by default anymore for
unencrypted rooms.

## [0.29.0] 08th May 2024

Refactoring release which fixes a flickering of sent file events in the timeline. The
State events in a room are no longer instances of `Event` but `StrippedStateEvent` by
default, which is a base class of `Event`. Usually in join rooms the state events are
actually `Event` and can be used as those after a type check if needed.

**Example:**

```dart
// Before:
final event = room.getState(EventTypes.RoomCreate);

// After:
final strippedStateEvent = room.getState(EventTypes.RoomCreate);
final event = strippedStateEvent is Event ? strippedStateEvent : null;
```

Also be aware that `Event.remove()` has been renamed to `Event.cancelSend()` to make
more clear that this is only to delete events from database and cache which have not
been synced yet. They no longer appear in the `Client.onEventUpdate` stream but on the new
`Client.onCancelSendEvent` stream.

## [0.24.1] - 7th December 2023

This release brings a new **experimental** database based on SQFlite and IndexedDB as a _Drop-In-Replacement_ for Hive and HiveCollections. You can already test it out (on your own risk) by using it as the new databaseBuilder and migrate your current users by using the legacyDatabaseBuilder with your current Database:

```dart
final client = Client('Client Name',
  databaseBuilder: (client) => MatrixSdkDatabase(
    'Database Name',
    database: await databaseFactory.openDatabase(':memory:'),
  ),
  legacyDatabaseBuilder: yourPreviousDatabase,
);
```

## [0.24.0] - 29th November 2023

This release deprecates `client.presences` in favor of `client.fetchCurrentPresence(userId)` as part of our journey to a more database centric memory management. However, `client.presences` is still functional and tested at least until the next major release.

Breaking change for users of dehydrated devices feature. This feature now implements the latest version of the MSC. It has been adapted to the current recent Synapse version and will from now on be incompatible with previous versions.

- feat: Update dehydrated devices implementation to current MSC (Nicolas Werner)
- fix: Delayed encrypted event in timeline not added to aggregated events (Krille)
- fix: don't delete the dehydrated device before we are sure the keys got saved (Nicolas Werner)

- refactor: Store fetched presence in db and deprecate own cache (Krille)

## [0.23.0] - 27th November 2023

This release includes a small breaking change. Starting a verification request now always returns a future. Specifically
this changes the DeviceKeys startVerification method to also return a future.

Additionally this release fixes a severe regression in the online key backup (keys only got uploaded once after startup
or before logout), excessive linebreaks in markdown messages and a few edge cases around when presence is sent.

- feat: Add sendRaw command (Krille)
- feat: Store presences in database (Krille)
- fix: Do only convert linebreaks to br tags in p blocks (Krille)

## [0.7.1] - 08nd Dec 2021

- fix: fallback in body for replies to replies (Nicolas Werner)
- fix: ignore 4xx errors when re-sending the to_device queue The to_device queue was introduced to ensure integrity if e.g. the server temporarily failed when attempting to send a to_device message. If, for whatever reason, the server responds with a 4xx error, though, then we want to ignore that to_device message from the queue and move on, as that means that something different was fundamentally wrong. This helps to fix the to_device queue clogging up, making clients incapable of sending to_device events anymore, should such clogging happen. (Sorunome)
- fix: Database corruptions by updating FluffyBox (Krille Fear)
- fix: Store the call state, fix the invite cannot be sent. (cloudwebrtc)
- fix: Allow consecutive edits for state events in-memory The lastEvent was incorrect when trying to process an edit of an edit. This fixes that by allowing consecutive edits for the last event. (Sorunome)
- fix: Only save state events from sync processing in-memory if needed If we dump all state events from sync into memory then we needlessly clog up our memory, potentially running out of ram. This is useless as when opening the timeline we post-load the unimportant state events anyways. So, this PR makes sure that only the state events of post-loaded rooms and important state events land in-memory when processing a sync request. (Sorunome)
- fix(ssss): Strip all whitespace characters from recovery keys upon decode Previously we stripped all spaces off of the recovery when decoding it, so that we could format the recovery key nicely. It turns out, however, that some element flavours also format with linebreaks, leading to the user having to manually remove them. We fix this by just stripping _all_ whitespace off of the recovery key. (Sorunome)

## [0.3.6] - 30nd Aug 2021

- hotfix: uiaRequests send broken auth object at first try

## [0.3.5] - 28nd Aug 2021

- hotfix: Send unencrypted thumbnails

## [0.3.4] - 28nd Aug 2021

- fix: String.parseIdentifierIntoParts not working with unicode matrix.to links
  Some clients do not uri-encode the identifier for matrix.to links, so we must
  handle if we can't uri-decode them
- fix: missing null check in hideEdit condition
- fix: missing null check
  It seems `device_keys` in the reply of `/keys/query` is not required. While synapse always
  sent it, conduit did not, which resulted in an error.

## [0.3.3] - 20nd Aug 2021

- fix: room.lastEvent order now respects edits
- feat: use m.new_content in lastEvent (so no more \* fallback)

## [0.3.0] - 20nd Aug 2021

- remove: deprecated moor database (breaking change)
- feat(events): add plain-text body representation from HTML
- feat: get new_content in getLocalizedBody
- feat: Add a way to get a verification request by its transaction id
  A client might find the need to get the verification request object by
  its transaction id, to be able to e.g. display for in-room verification
  an "accept verification request" button easily.
- fix: Correctly parse the reason of a spoiler
  Previously only the first child node of a spoiler was considered to
  determine if there should be a spoiler reason. This was, unfortunately,
  incorrect, as soon as e.g. the reason had more than one space. This is
  fixed by properly iterating all child nodes to search for the reason.
- fix: Add space states to important events
  We need the space state events in the important events to be able to
  differentiate rooms and spaces in the room list.
- feat: Allow specifying extraContent for Room.sendFileEvent, in case clients want to specify some custom stuff
- fix: toDouble was called on null when you had a pinned room
- fix: Typo in key backup requests
  This may lead to messages not decrypting after interactive verification,
  which would make the user manually press the request keys button.
- refactor: rename LoginState.logged to loggedIn

Please note: This removes the isolate code from the SDK to make it compatible with dart web. If
you still want the SDK to execute code in the background to not block the UI on key generation
for example, pass the `compute` method from Flutter to your client:

```dart
// ...
final client = Client('name...',
    // ...
    compute: compute,
);
```
